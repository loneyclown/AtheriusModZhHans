		Leaves will also spawn around the player's mouse every swing before coming back to them
		If the player is on the ground, rock formations will start sprouting up
		Every 3 swings the rocks get bigger before returning to normal size
		Rocks have a higher range and spawn more formations
		Rocks will also spawn under any enemies on the ground
